# Custom Cursors for Windows

This repository contains a collection of custom cursors for Windows. The cursors are designed to replace the default cursors in Windows with more visually appealing alternatives.

## Installation

To install the custom cursors, follow these steps:

1. Download the cursor files from the `cursors` directory.
2. Open the `Mouse Properties` dialog in Windows.
3. Select the `Pointers` tab.
4. Click the `Browse` button and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the cursor files.
5. Select the cursor file you want to use and click `Open`.
6. Repeat steps 4-5 for each cursor you want to replace.
7. Click `Apply` to save your changes.

## Contributing

If you have a custom cursor you'd like to contribute to this repository, please follow these guidelines:

- Cursors should be in the `.cur` or `.ani` format.
- Cursors should be visually appealing and easy to see.
- Cursors should be free to use and distribute.

## Special Thanks
